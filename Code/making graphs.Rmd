Generating some plots: State-reform. 

```{r}
plot_1 <- ggplot(dat_2, aes(year,meanstatecrime, color= State)) +  xlab("Year") + ylab("Mean Offenses") + ggtitle("Mean Offenses per State") + scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:2100) #Just to look at the general state trends for mean state crime
plot_all_states <- plot_1 + geom_line(aes(group=State)) + geom_point(size=1)
plot_all_states
#This also shows all the states that we have consistent 3-year data on. 
```

Okay, now to isolate the two states that we care about, making the rest of them grey.

```{r}
#Changing the order of 'statecolors' (for the sake of the plot)
dat_2 <- dat_2 |>
  mutate(statecolors = factor(statecolors))
levels(dat_2$statecolors)
dat_2$statecolors <- factor(dat_2$statecolors, levels = c("Maine", "Oregon", "No reform"))
levels(dat_2$statecolors)

#Generating a plot that has the non-reform states in grey
ref = "No reform"
adjustcolor("grey", alpha.f = .2) #Making 'grey' transparent for the plot
myColors <- brewer.pal(length(levels(dat_2$statecolors)),"Set1")
names(myColors) <- levels(dat_2$statecolors)
myColors[names(myColors)==ref] <- "#BEBEBE26" #If not a reform state, then assign grey color
colScale <- scale_colour_manual(name = "Reform States",values = myColors)

plot_reform_states <- ggplot(dat_2, aes(year,meanstatecrime, color=statecolors)) + scale_colour_manual(name = "Reform States",values = myColors) + geom_line(aes(group=State)) + geom_point(aes(group=State),size=2) +  xlab("Year") + ylab("Mean Offenses") + ggtitle("Mean Offenses - Zoning Reform States") + scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:2100)
plot_reform_states
```

Generating some plots: Municipal-level reform.
