"The City of Anchorage adopted an ordinance which removed mandatory parking minimums from the city. The policy goals of this reform were threefold. First, the city intends to make multi-family housing more affordable to build. Second, the city intends to encourage adaptive reuse of underutilized and vacant properties. Third, the city intends to encourage non-automobile forms of mobility and walkability."
"The City of Anchorage adopted an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) reform ordinance, and it made three central changes. The first is that it allowed ADUs to be built on single-family zoned districts across the jurisdiction. The second is that it allowed for ADU development on multi-family and commercially zoned districts, which makes the policy more extensive than many others enacted in the US. The third is that it reduced certain owner occupancy requirements for building or renting an ADU. Lastly, it seems that the city has intentions of making the ADU process public-facing and as accessible as possible, to the segment of the public who could utilize the policy."
"The City Council of Tucson adopted an ordinance to allow Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs), or what they also refer to as casitas, in zones that allow residential uses. There are three main parts to this ordinance. The first is that one ADU is permitted per residential lot. The second is that there are height limits for an ADU of either 12ft, or the height of the primary structure. The last is that an ADU requires 1 additional off-street parking, but this can be waived for lots close to transit or cycling infrastructure. An important provision of this ordinance is that it will sunset in late 2026, unless extended by the city."
"The City of Tucson adopted their Downtown Area Infill Incentive District (IID) in 2009, and it has been updated somewhat regularly in subsequent years. In its first implementation, the downtown district had two main goals. The first was to facilitate infill development. The second was to establish a transit-oriented development (TOD) program for the downtown area of the city. We include this effort into our tracker because it was an early TOD overlay which has allowed for new housing and economic development in the jurisdiction, over time."
"The City of Tucson adopted their Downtown Area Infill Incentive District (IID) in 2009, and it has been updated somewhat regularly in subsequent years. This update in 2022 was a major reformulation of the ordinance, which made several central changes. The first is that it allowed for residential development in industrial areas. The second is that it further incentivized affordable housing through its TOD provision. The third is that it extended the spatial coverage of the overlay. The fourth is that it removed the sunset provision of the ordinance, which would have otherwise removed the ordinance from the code if it wasn't extended by the city after a certain date. We include this effort into our tracker because it was an early TOD overlay which has allowed for new housing and economic development in the jurisdiction, over time."

"The City of Berkeley passed an ordinance which removed mandatory parking minimums from the zoning code. The purpose and the intentions of the city with this reform were largely based around removing the minimums in order to: A) promote more housing, and B) disincentivize car infrastructure and promote green forms of mobility, in light of the climate crisis. An important context for this reform, besides the broad consensus in planning research showing that parking minimums are not good policy from a housing or climate perspective, is a study by the city found which that over 50% of parking in the city remains nonutilized and vacant."
"The City Council of Berkeley approved their Housing Element, following an initial rejection from the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). The plan itself was initially adopted on January 18, 2023 in the Berkeley City Council, but the update was rejected by HCD because it didn't go far enough in: A) specifying how the city would upzone higher opportunity communities, and B) making technical changes in the permitting process which would make fulfilling the city's building goals more feasible. The new housing element made three central changes. The first is that it allowed property owners to establish plex multifamily units in areas which were before only limited to single-family property. The second is that it removed barriers from the approval process by doing away with public hearing provisions. The third is that it intentionally identified certain streets to upzone, and to specifically focus efforts on for future multifamily development, throughout the city (College, Solano and Shattuck Avenues). It may be expected that these directives will be codified through ordinances hereafter."
"The City Council of Culver City adopted an ordinance that removed mandatory parking minimums from the zoning code. The ordinance made three changes. First, it formally removed parking minimums from the zoning code while also specifying that such a removal does not preclude the provision of parking for development. Second, it streamlined administrative processes for alternative parking methods. Third, it shifted bicycle parking requirements throughout the city. The most important change, clearly, and the one most constitutive of zoning reform is the first."
"In the City of Los Angeles, ACT-LA, a coalition of organizations focused on transit, housing and labor, organized to get Measure JJJ on the 2016 ballot. The measure itself passed in November 2016, and resulted in the amendment of the LA Municipal Code which created the Transit Oriented Communities (TOC) program, which is a part of the larger Build Better LA Initiative. This program itself instituted an incentive system to create more dense construction of rental housing near major transit corridors and stations. An important feature of the program is that it mandated a certain share of affordable housing in each development for residents at different income brackets, which is part and parcel of its inclusionary requirement. Lastly, the program instituted hiring preferences for local labor if the building project meets certain conditions."
"The City of Oakland adopted their 2023 - 2031 Housing Element, and it was subsequently approved by CA HCD following an initial request for revision from the department. This general plan update sets the intention and outline for three central changes to the city's zoning, land-use and housing policy. The first is that it identifies ways to work against single-family exclusive zoning through a missing middle housing approach. The second is that it identifies ways to build and maintain more affordable housing units across the city. The third is that it outlines tenant-supportive policy through an anti-displacement and racial justice framework. These intentions will need to be codified through ordinances in the future, and we might expect these codifications to occur within the near future."
"The City of Oakland is currently working on refining their 2045 General Plan. This general plan update is slated to make three central changes. The first is that it will implement missing middle housing updates that'll expand the formerly Two-Family district into a Two-to-Four Family district, and allow up to 4-units to be built in more areas across the city. The second is that it will create an affordable housing overlay zone and a housing site overly zone, both of which will expand ministerial approval and height/density incentives for developments that meet certain conditions. The third is that it will approach industrial rezoning through an environmental justice perspective, to reduce impacts on at-risk geographies and communities. According to the city, the public review period for these changes ended in May 2023; though it is unclear when exactly these changes may be adopted and then, further codified, by the city."
"The City of Sacramento is currently in the process of drafting out its 2040 General Plan Update. This general plan should have provisions for instituting duplexes, fourplexes and other forms of missing middle housing, in all residential zoned land throughout the city. Another note is that the city has expressed interest in encouraging transit and walkability; which may be a sign that the city is interested in instituting a transit-oriented development program - yet this component is less clear than than the intention of Plex reform. The city has issued a Public Review Draft of the general plan which is now accessible to the public, and this document may go under another series or review by council before it is then adopted, likely, sometime in the future."
"The City of San Diego passed an ADU amendment which was seen as being one of the most progressive in the state of California. This ordinance made three central changes. First, it permitted attached and detached ADUs on single-family zoned lots. Second, it specified that both owner occupancy and minimum parking were not requirements for the establishment of an ADU. Third, a measure which made this ordinance distinct from many others, is that it instituted an affordable housing bonus program for ADUs. Concerning the bonus program, it allows an additional ADU to be permitted for every ADU that meets the low-income or moderate-income affordability bracket, effectively allowing multiple ADUs to be established on a single lot."
"The City of San Diego passed their ""Homes for All of Us"" housing and zoning amendment package. This package is too large to summarize in brief, but we will focus on its three most significant domains. First, it set the stage for a minor future concession to the city's ADU Bonus program, whereby the deed-restriction for very low and low-income affordability was reduced from 15-years to 10-years. Albeit following this concession, the city's ADU ordinance is still likely the least restrictive and most progressive in the state. Second, the ordinance instituted seven new housing incentive programs, including at least one for transit-oriented development. Third, the ordinance specified that a property owner seeking to build an ADU can either go the route of the city's ordinance, or the route of the state law, or SB 9; but not both."
"The City of San Diego has developed an infrastructure to annually update its zoning code through receipt of feedback from residents. While it may be superfluous to include every year in which this update process occurs, it must be noted that the updates for this particular year are quite poignant; and that this process would make two central changes. First, it would expand the city's transit-oriented development (TOD) program to make more land available for density bonuses. Second, it would expand the list of zoning districts where their accessory dwelling unit (ADU) Bonus Program is allowed, thereby increasing the efficacy of their prior ordinances on ADUs. Specifically, the ordinance would make eligible for the bonus program all lots within 1-mile of a major transit stop, instead of the preceding 1/2 mile qualifier."
"The City of San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed an ordinance that allowed single family zoned areas to build fourplexes, and six-units on corner lots. A prior complication with this ordinance was that its earlier text, which removed single-family zoning in the city, may have had the effect of exempting the city from CA state's SB9 lot split and ADU law. Within the current legislative state of the city, a homeowner trying to expand their property can do so through the SB9 ministerial ADU process, or through the process outlined in this municipal ordinance."
"The City of San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed an ordinance that removed mandatory parking minimums from the zoning code. The city's reasoning behind the reform is that: A) a planning department study found that parking minimums add $20-50k more to the cost of an apartment, and B) that excessive parking incentivizes driving, leads to traffic and may form infrastructure which isn't suited for pedestrian safety. The jurisdiction joins a growing list of other jurisdictions who have removed parking minimums from a green-climate and housing perspective."
"The City of San José passed an ADU ordinance which made three central changes to its zoning code. First, it expanded where ADUs are allowed, now including two-family areas and any lot where a single-family residence is built. Second, it created a provision for allowing junior accessory dwelling units (JADUs) to be established, if they are attached or interior to the principal dwelling. Third, it increased clarity and reduced regulations regarding ADU dimensions, design standards, and parking."
"The City Council of San José adopted an ordinance that removed mandatory parking minimums from the zoning code. The ordinance made three changes. The first is that it removed parking minimums throughout the entirety of the city. The second is that it implemented a Transportation Demand Management (TDM) requirement for each developmental project, whereby a developer is required to choose a set of measures to reduce vehicle miles travelled and to encourage green alternatives of transport. Third, the removal of parking minimums also coincides with the city affirming an intention of flexibility for land-uses allowed in particular buildings; they have also affirmed their intention of allowing for alternative developments in otherwise unused parking lots."
"The City Council of Denver, as a part of their Comprehensive Plan 2040, created the BluePrint Denver document, which is a land use and transportation supplement of the broader general plan. BluePrint Denver created recommendations to allow Plex development in single-family zoned areas in the city, as well as changes which made ADU construction a target for the city, and a more feasible option for creating housing across greater segments of the city."
"The City of Denver is in an ongoing zoning rewriting process. It's BluePrint Denver, which is the city's land use and transportation plan, and a supplement to the Comprehensive Plan 2040, called for enabling at least three central zoning reforms. The first is allowing plex development on single-family lots, the second is expanding where ADUs are permitted across the city, and the third is creating incentive structures for rental housing development in transit-dense areas. As of early 2021, Denver had initiated an ongoing zoning code update, and their Advancing Equity in Rezoning Task Force is working on a set of zoning code changes, which will codify the recommendations in BluePrint Denver and the Comprehensive Plan 2040. As stated on their website at the time of this entry, this process may yield implementation sometime in 2024."
"The City of Hartford adopted an ordinance which removed mandatory parking minimums from the zoning code. This change occurred following more more piecemeal, yet extensive, policy from the city in the past, which saw the removal of parking minimums in downtown, as well as the removal of parking minimums for retail and service commerce across the entirety of the city."
"The Board of Alders of New Haven approved an ordinance which made it easier for homeowners in single-family areas to build attached ADUs. The ordinance itself is a part of the city's intention to phase in ADUs into single-family zoned areas, and the ordinance may be a stepping stone towards future legislation allowing detached ADU structures. To conclude, as of yet, the municipal code of the city merely allows ADU construction in the form of garages, attics, and basements, or other 'existing' structures, but not building detached ADUs from scratch."
"The City Council of Jacksonville approved an ordinance, called the ""Keeping Families Together Act,"" which allowed detached or attached ADUs on single-family zoned areas. A limitation with the ordinance is that an ADU is not permitted without exception, and may be denied due to a homeowner association rules for a neighborhood. So while this ordinance allows ADUs, its method of permitting doesn't preempt other local restrictions which may reduce its effectiveness."
"The City Commision of Gainesville passed two essential ordinances which essentially removed single-family zoning in the jurisdiction. This is the most important ordinance of the two which we include in our tracker, and it did a few things. The first is that it replaced the Residential Single Family districts with a broader Neighborhood Residential (NR) zoning district. The second is that it established that in the NR district, plex development (inclusive of duplexes, triplexes, and in some cases, fourplexes) is permitted. The third is that it established that its provisions aren't subject to a sunset, but will last in permanence, into the future; in line with this, the ordinance amends both the zoning code, as well as the general plan. (The other ordinance which we do not record in our tracker is Ordinance No. 211359.)"
"The City Commission of Gainesville adopted an ordinance that removed mandatory parking minimums from the zoning code. The ordinance made three changes. First, it removed parking minimums throughout the entirety of the city and for all land-use types. Second, it established a parking maximum. Third, it requires that any development exceeding 200 parking spaces needs to construct a structured parking facility along with the main development."
"The City Commision of Gainesville, newly seated following the local election, set intentions to reverse the prior ordinances which eliminated single-family zoning in the city. Following the adoption of the ordinances, the city received threats of looming legal challenges from the state of Florida, principally the state's Department of Economic Opportunity. The city also received resistance from local community members. The Commision has formally reversed its prior ordinances with 3-ordinances based around restoring exclusionary zoning, and specifically, with the purpose of removing the formerly instated 'Neighborhood Residential' district from the city's zoning code. Gainesville is likely the most prominent case wherein a jurisdiction instituted a positive zoning reform, and then reversed and/or rejected it eventually, due to political factors."
"The City Council of Atlanta, following a commissioned team that was formed to assess its zoning code, sought to make substantial changes to the Atlanta Zoning Ordinance. This ordinance was a part of the first phase of those changes, which the city defined as ""quick fixes"" to the code. This ordinance made three central changes, exactly. The first is that it increased the maximum allowable height of ADUs, the second is that it increased the maximum allowable size of ADUs, and the third is that it clarified accessory uses in residential subdivisions."
"The City Council of Atlanta, following a commissioned team that was formed to assess its zoning code, sought to make substantial changes to the Atlanta Zoning Ordinance. This was a part of the second phase of those changes, which the city defined as ""medium fixes"" to the code. This ordinance did two things, exactly. The first is that it specified the total number of units on a parcel in accommodation of ADUs, and the second is that it removed parking requirements for ADUs."
"The City of Atlanta is engaging in a multi-year zoning code rewrite project. The purpose of this effort will likely be to secure and make more feasible ADU, and Plex development in single-family zoned areas throughout the city; but the exact details of the rewrite remain unspecified, as they are being established in a forward looking process. This zoning code rewrite itself is projected to conclude sometime in the Summer of 2024."
"The City Council of Atlanta was deciding earlier on an ADU ordinance drafted by Councilmember Farokhi, but it was ""filed,"" or essentially softly struck down, due to political disagreement expressed by the city's 25 Neighborhood Planning Units (NPUs). The ordinance itself would have amended the current language of the zoning code concerning ADUs, and would have made three central changes. The first change is that it would have allowed ADUs to be built or converted throughout a broader scope of the city. The second is that it would have increased the maximum allowable size of ADUs. The third is that it would have removed a minimum parking requirement."
"The City Council of Atlanta was considering an ordinance which would have implemented a Transit Oriented Development (TOD) policy throughout the entire city. This ordinance would have worked principally through rezoning transit stops near high traffic stations. Specifically, Low-Density Residential zones within half a mile of high-capacity transit stations would have been upzoned to Multifamily Residential Multi-Use (MR-MU). The outcome was that the ordinance was essentially ""referred,"" meaning filed away, or softly struck down."
"The Decatur City Commission, following a recommendation from its Affordable Housing Task Force, approved an ordinance which legalized Plex development on single-family zoned districts. This ordinance made at least two significant changes to the city's prior code. The first is that it allowed duplex and (up to 4-unit) walk-up flats to be built in single-family zoned areas, and the second is that it allowed single-family homes themselves to be converted into these missing middle housing types."
"The City of Chicago passed the Connected Communities Ordinance, which is a codification of a selection of equity-based improvements from a study made by the city of its preceding TOD policy. The ordinance itself is intended to make three changes. The first is to more equitably site TOD developments, without commensurately creating displacement. The second is to expand the policy's existent financial incentives. The third is to implement different ways of making streets safer for pedestrians, cyclists and transit users, around TOD sites."
"The City of Chicago adopted an ordinance which permitted ADU construction in 5-pilot areas across the city. According to the ordinance, all R-residential zoned areas, except for the residential single-family zoned areas (RS-1), are permitted to have ADUs. Furthermore, ADUs may be accessory to a primary dwelling unit, or internal to it, or constructed on multifamily zoned districts as well; in the latter case, depending on the density of the lot, the ordinance permits up to 4-interior ADUs. The ordinance also has affordability standards which go into effect after the construction of 2 or more units."
"The City of Evanston adopted an ADU ordinance which made three central changes. The first is that it permitted both attached and detached ADUs in single-family zoned areas throughout the city. The second is that it specified a maximum size of 1,000 sqft for ADUs, which is slightly greater than most other jurisdictions. The third is that it specified that no additional parking space is required for adding an ADU to a lot."
"The City of Carmel was considering an ordinance which would have made ADUs more numerous and easy to build on single-family zoned land in the city. The ordinance would have accomplished this in two main changes. The first is that it would have reduced the difficulty of the ADU application process by removing the requirement to apply to the Board of Zoning Appeals for approval. The second is that it would have required that 20% of new residential lot development have an ADU. Due to conflict in the council, and dilutions of the original ordinance, the amended ordinance was eventually struck down in the council. The current process for constructing or converting an ADU in the city requires a homeowner interested in this form of development, to apply for approval through the Carmel Board of Zoning Appeals."
"The Common Council of South Bend adopted an ordinance that removed mandatory parking minimums from the zoning code. The ordinance applies to both commercial and residential developments and follows an earlier city effort, in the year of the city-wide adoption, which saw the city remove parking minimums in the designated downtown of the jurisdiction."
"The Iowa City Council adopted an ordinance which instituted a form-based code for 900 acres of residential land in the South District of the city. The ordinance itself was passed with the intention of creating capacity for mixed-use and missing middle housing such as duplex and fourplexes, in the area. A limitation with this ordinance is that it only permits form-based code in a small area of the city, within the South District in particular, and not throughout the entire jurisdiction."
"The Louisville Metro Council passed an ordinance which allowed both attached and detached ADU construction by-right in the metro, with special standards. A prior version of the code merely allowed ADUs to be established through a conditional-use permitting process, which made it considerably more difficult for them to be established. The ADU ordinance made three central changes. The first is that it allowed ADUs by-right with certain special standards. The second is that it created a provision deterring ADU construction or conversion for an absentee landlord. The third is that it prohibited ADU construction in environmentally constrained areas."
"The Louisville Metro Council is currently in early stages of implementing its Land Development Code (LDC) update, which will codify some of the changes established in their Plan 2040. In this code update, single-family zoning reform is situated as a priority. While it is unclear exactly the extent to which this general plan will considerably change the ubiquity of single family zoning in the jurisdiction, or land-use provisions more generally, the intention established in the planning process appears to be two-fold. First, the zoning code update will focus on missing middle housing, which may be constitutive of Plex reform, whereby the allowed density of single-family zoned areas are increase marginally. Second, the zoning code update will focus on establishing new form-based regions within the jurisdiction. Specified details of these efforts will be confirmed upon the adoption of the code update."
"The Urban County Council of the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government, as a codification of their 2018 Comprehensive Plan, passed an ordinance focused on ADU reform in single-family zoned areas. This ordinance specifically allowed for the conversion of detached ADUs such as garages or barns, as well as construction of exterior and internal ADUs that are attached to a primary dwelling. Both types of ADUs are only permitted in single-family zoned areas. An important note is that the ordinance does require a pre-application conference with the planning department, before submitting a building permit application for the ADU."
"The Urban County Planning Commission of Lexington-Fayette County adopted an ordinance that removed mandatory parking minimums from the zoning code. The ordinance made three changes. First, it consolidated all of the disparate locations of the code where parking standards were mentioned. Second, it removed the minimum parking standards for new developmental projects. Third, it increased tree canopy and vehicle use requirements for parking lots. The jurisdiction joins a growing list of others who have removed parking minimums from a green-climate, walkability, and housing perspective."
"The Lafayette City Council passed a form-based amendment to their downtown code. The code update implemented a form-based design, which centers the physical form of a place as opposed to a concrete code, to encourage mixed-use development. A limitation with this code update to the Downtown Plan is that the revision itself, clearly, only pertains to the downtown area of the city, and it does not at all alter single-family zoning throughout the entirety of the city."
"The City Council of Auburn Maine adopted an ADU ordinance which made three principal changes. The first is that it expanded permitted ADU types from merely internal or attached ADUs, to detached ADUs. The second is that it removed normal size limits and greatly increased the height limits for established ADUs, so that the accessory unit can ultimately be larger than the principal dwelling. The third is that it specified that these units can be built on both single-family zoned land and also land zoned for duplexes."
"The City Council of Auburn Maine adopted a form-based code ordinance, which we have characterized as a reform type of Other, in our type classification. This ordinance made two main changes. The first is that it rezoned just over 1,500 acres in the central part of the city to make the land more amenable to mixed-use development. The second is that, instead of implementing many regulations to this district, the city merely set the density standard of this district to 16 dwelling units per acre - which allows for somewhat dense multifamily housing."
"The City Council of South Portland passed an ordinance that permitted ADUs on all residential zoned land throughout the city. The ordinance made three changes. The first is that it removed the administrative barrier of a Planning Board public hearing which was prior required to gain approval. The second is that it removed the parking requirements prior associated with ADU construction or conversion. The third is that it specified that owner occupancy is required for establishing an ADU."
"The City of Baltimore is considering an ordinance that seeks to lay the way for missing middle housing, particularly through Plex development. Conditional on its adoption, this ordinance will institute three changes. The first is that it will allow for low-density multi-family housing, or duplex to fourplex development, on single-family zoned areas. The second is that it will allow greater density in locations closer to public transportation hubs. The third is that it will remove parking minimums related to residential development. According to the City of Baltimore – as of May 18th, 2023 – the ordinance has had its first public hearing and will then progress to the city council committee which is assigned to it and which will subsequently review it."
"The City of Cambridge passed an ordinance which removed minimum parking requirements from their zoning code. Specifically, it removed off-street parking requirements that had prior existed as a condition of development. The reasoning for this removal, as much research has shown, is that parking minimums make development more expensive, raise rents, and reduce the total units established for a given project; much research establishes that it is also misuse space, and encourage dependence on automobiles."
"The City of Boston adopted an ordinance, which codified a prior 18-month long pilot program, that allowed internal ADUs in lots that have 1-3 units. The ordinance itself did not allow for the conversion of an external structure on a single-family lot, nor for the construction of an ADU from scratch. Therefore, due to this ordinance only permitting an ADU so long as it works within the existing dimensions of the primary residence, it might be seen as being limited in comparison to other ordinances, which legalize lot splits and detached ADU construction."
"The City Council of Greenfield adopted an ADU ordinance which allowed both attached and detached ADUs in single-family land across the city. The major limitation of this ordinance was that it required a special permit in order for an ADU to be established in any given lot. The special permit process, as opposed to a ministerial review process, is not enclosed from community input - so by its nature, this first ordinance opened up a space in the approval process for community obstruction, which had the outcome of reducing the effectiveness of this measure."
"The City Council of Greenfield adopted an ADU ordinance which amended their prior ADU policy. The main change that this ordinance made was that it removed the requirement for securing a special permit for attached and internal ADUs, which the earlier ADU ordinance had instated, and which generally makes establishing ADUs more difficult. A caveat is that a detached ADU still requires a special permit. This ordinance can be summarized in three parts. First, it allows both attached and detached ADUs on single-family zoned land. Second, it requires owner occupancy for establishing and continuing to rent an ADU. And third, it requires 2 off-street parking spots for a new ADU."
"The City Council of Somerville passed an zoning code update, which was brought to the city by means of a ""citizen petition."" The ordinance fulfilled numerous directives of its Master Plan, but there are three central and important changes which it made. The first is that it increased the affordability requirements to 20% for many new developments in the city, which improved its prior inclusionary zoning policy. The second is that it permitted backyard cottages on most residentially zoned land. The third is that it implemented a form-based code throughout the entirety of the jurisdiction."
"The City Council of Grand Rapids passed a form-based code throughout the entirety of the city. The purpose of this early form-based reform was to allow more multi-family construction in lower density residential areas, and provide more flexible uses for property owners and businesses. While form-based reforms still implicitly depend on exclusionary frameworks of ""community character"" in order to function, and may therefore be subject to certain limitations, they are generally seen as changes that allow for more flexibility in land use and development, especially when compared with restrictive code-based or Euclidean zoning."
"The City Council of Grand Rapids passed a set of ordinances which changed its zoning code in three considerable ways. This is one of those ordinances, and it focused principally on Plex development on single-family land. This ordinance instituted two major changes. The first is that it permitted the construction or conversion of duplexes on corner lots in single-family zoned areas. The second is that it reduced the square footage requirements for these corner lot duplexes."
"The City Council of Grand Rapids passed a set of ordinances which changed its zoning code in three considerable ways. This is one of those ordinances, and it focused principally on inclusionary zoning and incentivizing rental housing construction near transit. The ordinance established three major sets of bonuses for certain rental housing construction. The first are configured to increase affordable housing construction. The second are configured to increase rental housing construction near transit lines. And the third are configured to increase mixed-income housing."
"The City Council of Grand Rapids passed a set of ordinances which changed its zoning code in three considerable ways. This is one of those ordinances, and it focused principally on ADU development on single-family land. This particular ordinance has a major limitation, in that it instituted a provision for a public hearing process, which is a process wherein neighbors within 300ft of a prospective ADU development are notified, and can delay the project through public hearings. This provision is likely to reduce the effectiveness of the ordinance, and limit the extent to which ADUs may be realized in the city. Though this is the case, even with the current public hearing provision, the ADU application process is easier than it was earlier in the city, wherein there was a special land use application process required for ADUs."
"The City Council of Ann Arbor passed an amendment of its zoning code, which reformed the city's ADU provisions. The ordinance made three central updates. The first is that it expanded the total eligible properties wherein one might construct or convert an ADU. The second is that is generally reduced restrictions in the application and approval process. The third is that it reduced the parking minimum, but still requires at least one off-street parking spot for an ADU if the lot isn't within a 1/4 mile of a bus stop."
"The City of Ann Arbor approved a transit-oriented development (TOD ordinance). First, the ordinance created a new district, the Transit Corridor (TC1) district, in order to facilitate transit oriented development in the jurisdiction. This district is intended to create at least two-story housing close to transit, with the purposes of encouraging infill development, expanding multi-family housing variety and option, and generate walkable and mobile communities."
"The City of Saint Paul passed an ordinance which updated their zoning code to be more conducive to ADU development, in line with the recommendations from their earlier 1-4 Unit Infill Housing Zoning Study. The city first allowed a narrow scope of the city to have ADUs in 2016, and then expanded ADUs to the entire city in 2018. This ordinance is an extension of those prior ordinances, and the current state of ADUs in the jurisdiction are as follows. First, ADUs are allowed on all single-family zoned districts throughout the city. Second, the owner occupancy requirement is no longer required for establishing an ADU. Third, a maximum of three ADUs can be built on lots containing one to two-family dwelling, so long as the maximum size is under 1,200sqft."
"The City of Minneapolis passed a series of ordinances to permit ADUs throughout the city. Due to the piecemeal nature of these ordinances, and the fact that only comprehensively do they really amount to an ADU reform, we have identified the single most important ordinance out of the series of 7-ordinances present in the broader effort. The ordinance made three central changes. The first is that it allowed ADUs on what was prior single-family zoned land throughout the city. The second is that it specified an owner-occupancy requirement for the construction or conversion of an ADU. The third is that it specified that no additional parking spot need be required for ADUs."
"The City of Minneapolis adopted the Minneapolis 2040 Plan, which prospectively eliminated single-family zoning, and set the grounds for other zoning code changes. It is often seen as emblematic of contemporary zoning reform on a national level. This plan has set the stage to make three major changes in the city. First, up to triplexes would be permitted on prior single-family zoned districts. Second, density limits would be raised for apartment development surrounding transit stops and stations. Third, mandatory parking minimums would be removed from the code."
"The City of Minneapolis adopted the Minneapolis 2040 Plan, which prospectively eliminated single-family zoning, and set the grounds for other zoning code changes. This is one of the ordinances which followed up after the plan, to codify it. The ordinance is focused on Plex reform and made two main changes. The first is that it removed single and two-family codes from the zoning code and replaces it with the ""Multiple Family District"" code. The second is that it allowed for up to triplexes to be built on this expanded residential code, across the city."
"The City of Minneapolis adopted the Minneapolis 2040 Plan, which prospectively eliminated single-family zoning, and set the grounds for other zoning code changes. This is one of the ordinances which followed up after the plan, to codify it. This ordinance focused on inclusionary zoning reform and made one central change: in order for a rental development with over 20-units to be approved, it must make a certain number of their units affordable."
"The City of Minneapolis approved an ordinance to remove parking minimums throughout the city. Removing parking minimums is seen by some as being conducive to creating cities that are less car dependent; it is also seen as a policy lever which reduces wasted space, as well as the costs associated with a development, which may have impacts on the total number of units built, and their associated rental costs."
"The City of Richfield adopted an ordinance which amended its zoning code. This ordinance makes two central changes. The first is that it allows duplexes on land parcels prior devoted exclusively to single-family dwellings; it made this change by eliminating the Two Family Residential (MR-1) district and amending the Single Family Residential (R) district to incorporate the duplex use into it. The second change is that it reduces the minimum lot size of low-density parcels, effectively allowing for more housing to be built on what would've been prior empty space adjacent or surrounding a single-family configuration. Concerning the latter reform subset, reforms in developmental standards are often not given as much attention as reforms in land-use, but they are quite important as well."
"The City of Rochester adopted a new development code which made important changes, following more than 20-years of the city not having updated their zoning code. This reform made three central changes. The first is that it reduced the minimum lot size of many residential districts throughout the city. The second is that it allowed for mixed-use housing in prior commercial areas. The third is that it made setbacks and floor-area-ratio (FAR) regulations more amenable to missing middle housing development."
"The City Council of Kansas city approved an ADU ordinance. This ordinance made three central changes. The first is that is permitted attached and detached ADUs on all lots with a detached primary dwelling, which are essentially all single-family zoned districts. The second is that it instituted an owner occupancy requirement. The third is that it specified that additional parking isn't required for ADUs."
"The City Council of Missoula approved an ADU ordinance, which mainly reduced regulations to their zoning code, which had already permitted ADUs in single-family zoned areas. This ordinance made three central changes. The first is that it removed the minimum parking requirement for the establishment of an ADU. The second is that it removed the owner-occupancy requirement for either constructing or renting out an ADU. The third is that it increased the maximum allowable height of ADUs."
"The City Council of Jersey City passed an ordinance which instituted an Affordable Housing Overlay (AFO) zone throughout the city. This zone carried with it a few general changes. The first is that it allowed multi-unit development in previously solely single-family zoned area. The second is that it instituted an two-tiered inclusionary zoning mandate, which alotts 10-15% affordability with added density bonuses and regulatory reductions for developers, dependent on neighborhood socio-economics. The third is that it required LIHTC development, or rental housing built using the low-income housing tax credit, to build with a 20% affordability standard. It is unclear the extent to which this overlay covers a considerable scope of the jurisdiction."
"The Township Committee of Maplewood adopted an ADU ordinance which made three central changes. The first is that it permitted ADUs throughout low-density residential zoned areas in the township. The second is that it specified that owner-occupancy is required to establish an ADU. The third is that it established that there is a maximum limit of one ADU per lot."
"The Princeton City Council adopted an ADU ordinance which made three central changes. The first is that it permitted ADUs throughout single-family zoned areas in the town. The second is that it specified that owner-occupancy is not required to establish an ADU. The third is that it allowed older and informal dwellings to be siloed into the ordinance, without necessarily needing to meet all of its regulatory standards."
"The City Council of Buffalo engaged in a long zoning code rewriting process, which culminated in its Buffalo Green Code; the new code itself is a form-based alternative to strict land-use type restrictions. The code made two large changes. The first is that it allowed for a more varied build environment. The second is that the city removed parking minimums from the code update. While form-based reforms still implicitly depend on exclusionary frameworks of ""community character"" in order to function, and may therefore be subject to certain limitations, they are generally seen as changes that allow for more flexibility in land use and development, especially when compared with restrictive code-based or Euclidean zoning."
"The City Council of Canandaigua adopted an ordinance that removed mandatory parking minimums from the zoning code. The ordinance made two changes. First, it removed parking minimums from all uses across the city. Second, it now requires developments which meet certain size requirements to fulfill a parking demand analysis to calculate whether or how much parking is needed for a given development."
"The Common Council of Hudson adopted an ordinance that removed parking minimums from its zoning code. The current code now establishes no minimum number of parking spots needed for new developments, but now leaves it up to the developer to determine parking demand and allocation, across all land-use types in the entirety of the city."
"The City Council of Albemarle adopted an ordinance that removed mandatory parking minimums from the zoning code. These changes to the parking standards run across nearly all commercial, industrial and residential uses, with a few exceptions. The city still requires 1-parking spot for ADU development."
"The City of Charlotte has adopted their Charlotte Future 2040 Comprehensive Plan, which proposed changes to the city's zoning code. The general plan made two major proposals. The first is related to plex development, and proposed allowing duplex to fourplex development on all residential zoned districts across the city. A caveat is that fourplexes would only be permitted in dense areas, and under some affordability conditions. The second proposal was to make ADUs easier to construct around the city's residentially zoned districts."
"The City of Charlotte adopted their Unified Development Ordinance (UDO), which is a consolidation of the Charlotte Future 2040 Comprehensive Plan, as it relates to zoning and development. This ordinance is large and fulfills many of the general plan's proposals, but it made two central changes. The first is that it allowed for duplex, triplex, and (under certain density conditions) fourplex development, on single-family land throughout the city. The second is that is made ADUs easier to construct in residentially zoned districts. An important specification is that though the UDO was adopted in late 2022, it will go into effect on June 1, 2023."
"The City and County of Durham led a years long effort, which included public input, to amend their Unified Development Ordinance. The outcome was the Expanding Housing Choices (EHC) program, which legalized duplexes, and ADUs on all residential zoning districts (as well as allowed for townhomes and low density multifamily housing). The effort also removed regulatory barriers for ADUs, reduced the minimum lot size to 2,000sqft, and allowed for lot splits. A note is that with the lot split amendment, it's possible to have an ADU and duplex construction on one lot, and an ADU and single family housing construction for the other lot, respectively."
"The City Council of Gastonia adopted an ordinance that removed mandatory parking minimums from the zoning code, and replaced them instead with parking maximums. These changes to the parking standards in the zoning code run across all commercial, industrial and residential uses, with the exception of bicycle parking."
"The City and County of Raleigh led a string of zoning reforms in recent years, which have targeted missing middle housing; this is one of those ordinances. In this particular ordinance, which has been titled ""Accessory Dwelling Units,"" the city made ADUs easier to construct through two changes. The first was removing a prior existing ADU overlay district (ADUOD), and the second was allowing ADUs on lots with existent attached or detached houses."
"The City and County of Raleigh led a string of zoning reforms in recent years, which have targeted missing middle housing; this is one of those ordinances. This particular ordinance, which has been titled ""Missing Middle Housing,"" made duplexes, townhouses and small apartment buildings easier to construct across the city and county. This intention was principally carried out in the ordinance through the expansion of the possible zoning districts wherein building missing middle housing types are permitted."
"The City and County of Raleigh led a string of zoning reforms in recent years, which have targeted missing middle housing; this is one of those ordinances. This particular ordinance, which has been titled ""Missing Middle Housing 2.0,"" makes duplexes, townhouses and small apartment buildings easier to construct across the city and county. It follows up on the foundation of the former ""Missing Middle Housing"" ordinance in three main ways. The first is that it further expanded the possible zoning districts wherein building missing middle housing are permitted, the second is that it reduced the minimum lot size on residential districts, and the third is that it encouraged Transit Oriented Development (TOD) by slightly changing building standards in places defined as Frequent Transit Areas."
"The City of Raleigh adopted an ordinance that removed parking minimums from the zoning code and replaced them with parking maximums in certain contexts. An important note is that developers are conditionally allowed to exceed the maximums. The jurisdiction joins a growing list of others who have removed parking minimums from a green-climate, walkability, and housing perspective."
"The City of Cincinnati adopted an ADU Reform. This reform made four central changes. First, it made both attached and detached accessory dwelling units (ADUs) permitted by-right throughout single-family zoned lots in the city. Second, it specified that owner-occupancy is a requirement for the building and renting out of an ADU. Third, it specified that no additional on-site parking is required for an ADU to be established, commensurate with its conversion or construction. And lastly, it specified that the owner of the primary residence can rent the unit out as a short-term rental."
"The City of Cincinnati is considering a combined Plex, TOD and Other reform to their zoning code. This ordinance is projected to make three central changes. The first is that it will legalize duplexes and triplexes within a radius of the city's 24-hours transit corridors. The second is that it will increase allowable residential density through various levers in the zoning code's developmental standards (eg. FAR, setbacks, height, minimum lot size, etc.), with the intended result of boosting housing production in the city. The third is that it will incentivize affordable housing development by easing restrictions on setback, minimum lot size, height, floor-area-ratio, and density – which may be constitutive of an inclusionary zoning policy. It is unclear whether the efforts intention on creating pedestrian and transit-focused communities will translate to a specific TOD policy, but this will ultimately be determined by the formation of the final codification of the effort."
"The City of Columbus is in a intensive process of rewriting its zoning code. There are several commitments which the Zone In Advisory Committee have expressed which we can use as a guide for future changes which this process may institute. These commitments are as follows: First, there should be walkable, mixed-use, and transit accessible development. Second, there should be a 'hybrid' code that includes form-based regulations, as opposed to solely use-based regulations. Third, there should be a reduction in parking requirements, at least in certain corridors. Fourth, the code should be simplified, and reconfigured so that it's more understandable to the public. Fifth, the code should facilitate affordable housing development, in preparation for the city's current needs and projected growth. This process may conclude by or near the year 2026, so only with time will the specificities of this intensive zoning code rewriting effort come forward."
"The Ashland City Council approved an ordinance that exempted ADUs from the planning application process, so long as they meet two conditions. The first condition is that a given ADU is within or attached to a single family primary dwelling unit. The second condition is that a given ADU is under 500sqft. In conclusion, this ordinance is not a more preferable unconditional ministerial process for ADU approval, but rather a simplification of the planning application process if a given ADU development satisfies certain conditions."
"The City Council of Portland adopted Part 1 of their Residential Infill Project, which might primarily be seen as a missing middle housing measure. This zoning code rewrite lasted a few years and the city collected around 15,000 comments from the community throughout its first part. This reform made three central changes. First, it allowed for more housing types in single-family zoned areas (including duplexes, triplexes and fourplexes), while also limiting their size. Second, it created a Housing Opportunity Overlay Zone which modified the base zone regulations and allowances for lots within range of certain centers, corridors and transit routes. Third, it included a ""deep affordability bonus"" which allowed for a 6-unit residence to be built on a certain lot, if half of the units were made affordable to households earning 60% of the area median income (AMI)."
"The City Council of Portland updated their Residential Infill Project, which had originally expanded missing middle housing options across most residential zones in the city, while also removing minimum parking requirements in many instances. Part 2 of the Residential Infill Project (RIP2) made at least three central changes. The first is that it allowed duplexes on all single-family zoned areas. The second is that it allowed up to fourplexes on an expanded segment of residentially zoned areas. The third is that it expanded attached houses and cottage clusters throughout an expanded segment of residentially zoned areas."
"The Tigard City Council approved a series of amendments to the Tigard Development Code, which made constructing missing middle housing easier; particularly ADUs. This ordinance can be summarized with three points. First, it specified that no additional parking is required for establishing an ADU. Second, it allowed 2 ADUs to be constructed on one single family lot, as long as one ADU is detached. Third, it set the maximum size for an ADU at 800sqft or less."
"The East Lampeter Township updated their zoning ordinance to implement an ADU reform. This ordinance made three central changes. The first is that it allowed accessory dwelling units (ADUs) by right in every zoning district where residential housing is allowed. The second is that is specified that interior, attached and detached ADUs are all permitted throughout all residential areas. The third is that it specified that 1 off-street parking spot is required to establish an ADU. It is unclear whether owner-occupancy is required to build or rent an ADU. (One of the sources which we link is the entire zoning code, as the township didn't have an individual ordinance for these changes on file.)"
"The City Council of Philadelphia passed an ADU ordinance which made three central changes. The first allowed ADUs by-right in single-family zoned areas. The second specified that ADUs must be located interior to the principal building, or be made from an existent detached structure. The third is that it specified that the maximum size of the structure is not to exceed 800sqft. The major difference with this ordinance and the previous code, was that the previous code merely included a definition of ADUs, but not specifications concerning the approval process for them."
"The Pittsburgh City Council is in an ongoing zoning code rewriting effort. The city passed an earlier resolution which required their Department of City Planning, as well as another agency, to report back on the ADU pilot program and the state of ADUs in the city. The city will now decide whether or not to codify or extend the permissibility of ADU construction beyond the narrow scope of its earlier two year-long ADU pilot overlay zone. As of now, the code is not very conducive to ADUs, and the specifities of the city's updates to the code, if they do in fact decide to update it, are unclear. It is important to note that although the 'Policy Name' field marks the concluded resolution, and that there has in fact been no complete codification of zoning change, and what was approved was merely a study and report back."
"The City of Rapid Falls passed an ADU ordinance which made three central changes. The first is that it allowed attached and detached ADU construction in single-family zoned area, as well as other zones, throughout the city. The second is that it implemented an owner occupancy requirement. The third is that it required parking for the associated ADU."
"The City of Jackson adopted an ordinance that removed parking minimums from the zoning code. The jurisdiction joins a growing list of others who have removed parking minimums from a green-climate, walkability, and housing perspective."
"The City of Nashville adopted their Downtown Code, which made three central changes. The first is that it implemented a form-based regulation, while removes use-based regulations, in order to expand mixed-use and diverse development types. The second is that it removed parking minimums. While these are two important changes, an important note is that these changes are limited to a very small geography within the entire jurisdiction, and therefore don't apply outside of the downtown area proscribed."
"The City of Austin approved an ordinance which created an affordable housing density program. This program essentially allow developers to increase density (ie. height, floor-area ratio) and reduce prior administrative restrictions (ie. setbacks, minimum site area, parking and compatibility, etc.), in exchange for them guaranteeing that a certain amount of units be affordable for residents at different income levels. One affordability option is that 50% of the units are affordable to those of 60% the median-family income of the Austin metro area."
"The City Council of Austin is in the process of considering an ordinance to remove minimum parking requirements from the zoning code. An important note is that the city has merely passed a resolution stating that the council is to have a prospective ordinance before it and before the turn of the year. Though this is the case, this is not the same as the adoption of an ordinance which actually removes parking minimums itself. Additionally, our specification that the resolution was approved at a certain date should not be taken as evidence that the parking minimum removal itself has been instated. It might be expected, given the majority support for the ordinance process in council, that it may pass under its next consideration; but more definite news on this will be confirmed in late 2023 or sometime in 2024."
"The City of Bastrop adopted an code amendment that removed parking minimums from the zoning code. It is unclear the exact date of adoption of the zoning amendment, but as an extension of the information provided in the referenced document, we have labeled the date as the first of November 2019. The jurisdiction joins a growing list of others who have removed parking minimums from a green-climate, walkability, and housing perspective. For more information, see SEC. 6.3.006 PARKING of the B3 Code."
"The City of Dallas is well into the process of its ""ForwardDallas” comprehensive land use update, which begun in 2021. The general plan process seems to signal at least three central intentions by the city. First, the city intends to expand missing middle housing options in single-family zoned areas. Second, the city intends to expand mixed-use development throughout larger parts of their jurisdiction. Third, the city intends to generally simplify the zoning code and the zoning-related processes within the city. The final outcome of the update will likely be determined by different iterations of public feedback as the update process closes. It is unclear the extent to which this update will considerably challenge widespread single-family zoning in the city, but more will be known as the update winds down and is adopted, and then becomes codified through ordinance."
"The City of Houston adopted a land-use reform which reduced the minimum lot size of single-family zoned parcels throughout a large portion of the city in 2013. This reform is much like the earlier 1999 adopted effort which reduced the minimum lot size from 5,000 sqft to 1,400 sqft within the I-610 loop; the only difference is that the earlier reform confined the minimum lot size reduction to the area of the city within the loop, while the 2013 reform affected single-family parcels in the entirety of the city outside of the highway boundary. While Houston is unique out of many American cities in that it doesn't have formal Euclidean zoning, it nevertheless still has land-use developmental standards which could constrain or allow for multifamily housing development and/or preferential treatment towards certain tenure types. It can be noted that the minimum lot size reform has allowed for more variegated tenure types, and more multifamily housing development, in areas which were, before the reform, predominantly concentrated with single-family dwellings."
"The City Council of Draper has proposed a series of zoning reforms in order to meet affordability needs, and the city's projected growth needs. These proposals span at least three central areas of intention. First, the code should be amended to be more conducive to attached and detached ADU development, by removing regulations and decreasing vagueness in the code. Second, the code should allow more transit oriented development (TOD) in commercial or mixed use areas. Third, there should be incentivizes for TOD and reduced impact fees for moderate income housing construction. An important note is that this general plan update process is related to Utah's HB462 law, which requires jurisdictions to update their plans to be in line with moderate-income housing construction requirements. Though this local ordinance is influenced by a state-based context, it is still substantial enough in its scope to be listed in our tracker."
"The City Council of Holladay proposed a study or implementation of several items related to housing and zoning. The most salient intentions are as follows. First, the city will allow for higher density and moderate income housing. Second, the city will reduce regulations and fees associated with moderate income housing, and make efforts for infill development in residential areas. Third, the city will study the outcomes of reducing parking minimums in residential areas. And fourth, the city will study the current existing impediments for building or converting attached and detached ADUs. An important note is that this general plan update process is related to Utah's HB462 law, which requires jurisdictions to update their plans to be in line with moderate-income housing construction requirements. Though this local ordinance is influenced by a state-based context, it is still substantial enough in its scope to be listed in our tracker."
"The City Council of Salt Lake City adopted an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) ordinance. It appears that the ordinance makes three central changes: 1) it allows ADUs by-right in single-family zoned areas throughout the city, 2) it aligns the code's specifications of internal ADUs with state requirements, and 3) it ""clarifies"" other ADU regulations. It is unclear what form the clarifications are, and whether the law extends beyond the mandates of Utah state's HB462, but it appears that the ordinance does represent a particular municipal reform which goes beyond the state mandate. Lastly, the ADU ordinance was passed with the purposes of creating new multi-family housing in low-residential districts, expanding housing choice and affordable housing, and supporting transit-oriented development."
"The City Council of Salt Lake City has proposed a set of affordable housing incentive policies which are linked with zoning reform. The proposed ""Affordable Housing Incentives"" effort would make three central changes. The first change is allowing for new multi-family housing types (eg. two-family, town houses, triplex, fourplex and cottage courts) in currently single- and two-family zoned areas; thereby opening up the affordability incentives from particular transit zones to the entirety of the city wherein these low-density family districts are found. The second change is increasing density requirements when affordability conditions are met, thereby allowing for more units to be built, in currently existing multi-family districts. The third is allowing for low-density residential housing and cottage courts on institutional land (eg. schools, hospitals and non-profits), with the potential of allowing multi-family housing in future legislation. The current changes expand the prior recommendations, considerably. It is unclear when this process will conclude, but the next step in this process is revising and finalizing the draft zoning text update language, passing it, and implementing it."
"The City Council of Burlington amended its zoning code to make ADU construction more viable. This ordinance made three central change. First, it streamlined the application process for ADUs. Second, it removed parking minimums for ADUs. And third, it expanded the maximum size allowed for ADUs, and the capacity for additional lot coverage."
"The City Council of South Burlington adopted an ordinance that removed parking minimums from the zoning code and replaced them with parking maximums. The jurisdiction joins a growing list of others who have removed parking minimums from a green-climate, walkability, and housing perspective."
"The City Council of Alexandria approved an ADU reform which made three central changes. First, it permitted attached or detached ADUs city-wide in residentially zoned areas (single-family, two-family or townhouse districts). Second, it removed minimum parking requirements for ADU construction or conversion. And third, while requiring owner-occupancy of the principal dwelling, it legalized short-term renting of the ADU, so long as the owner resides in the principal dwelling. (The last sentence is not a statement of support for the latter end of the policy, but merely a description of the elements of the ordinance.)"
"The City of Alexandria is currently undergoing a zoning code rewrite, where significant changes to the code are slated to be made. These prospective changes might be broken down in three parts. First, the city intends to inquire into how to expand opportunities and more income-varied housing types in single-family zoned areas, while also likely reducing parking requirements. Second, the city intends to create an affordable housing incentive district in particular segments of the jurisdiction. Third, the city intends to inquire into the possibility of expanding the spatial scope and allowable densities related to its current transit oriented development (TOD) policy. It is also important to note that the city has made an explicit effort, particularly with the ""Housing for All"" racial equity component of their effort, to link proposed zoning change to racial segregation and actual benefits for people of color and low-income people. It is unclear how the latter will become actualized, but more will be known as the effort continues to develop into the future."
"The County of Arlington approved considerable changes to their zoning code, following their Missing Middle Housing Study (MMHS). The reform makes three central changes. The first is that allows townhomes and buildings with 2-4 units to be established on currently single-family zoned land. The second reduces parking requirements for residential development throughout the city. The third is that it allows for the construction of of 5-6 unit multifamily housing in prior single-family zoned areas, but limit this construction to areas near public transit stations or to those with large lots. While the mechanism notes that this was an ""Intensive Zoning Code Effort,"" the county also made brief changes to their General Plan. A caveat with this effort is that there is a cap of 58-permits each year, until 2028. The latter was likely implemented to appease exclusionary homeowner interests, and seem to work against the scope of the changes implemented by the county."
"The City of Charlottesville updated their comprehensive plan, and set the outline for a few prospective changes in the city's zoning code. The three central proposed changes are as follows. First, the plan proposed the development of affordable, healthy and high-opportunity housing. Second, the plan proposed mixed-use and mixed-income development, with an eye towards permitting more diverse housing types by-right. Third, the plan proposed housing development which is geared towards walkability and public transit connection."
"The City of Charlottesville, in their Cville Plans Together effort to rewrite their zoning code, focus on implementing prior recommended changes made in the Affordable Housing Plan and Comprehensive Plan. This zoning code rewrite is ongoing, but may be primed to make three central changes. The first is to allow greater density on single-family zoned areas. The second is to create an inclusionary zoning policy. The third is to reduce or eliminate parking requirements, specifically for affordable housing development. This process is ongoing and it is unclear exactly when it will be concluded with a codification of zoning text changes; but the Fall of 2023 and beyond may yield such results."
"The City of Richmond adopted an ADU and Other reform. This reform make two central changes. First, it allows both internal, attached and detached ADUs in single-family zoned areas. Second, it removes minimum parking standards from the zoning code; specifically, the ordinance strips the minimums for off-street parking as well as loading spaces, which were prior linked to set figures derived from the floor-area, underlying zoning district, or number of units within a development."
"The District of Columbia (DC) Council passed a zoning code update which permitted ADUs on many residential zoning districts. A caveat of the ordinance is that in order to rent an ADU unit, the owner needs to apply for and attain a Residential Rental Business License from the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs. A limitation with this ordinance may be that it is administratively burdensome, which has limited the extent to which the ordinance has, in actuality, facilitated ADU construction across the district."
"The City Council of Seattle adopted an ADU bill which permitted detached ADUs on single-family zoned areas. The prior ADU ordinance, which was passed in 1994, had allowed internal ADUs, but this ordinance is more significant due to the way in which it extended approval to external ADUs in the forms of converted garages, and fully constructed backyard cottages. This ordinance, while extending beyond the one established at the end of the 20th-Century, was still limited and presented many regulatory barriers that limited the feasibility of establishing ADUs throughout the city."
"The City Council of Seattle adopted a significant ADU ordinance. This ordinance removed barriers for ADU construction in single-family zoned areas, and made three general changes. First, it allowed up to 2-ADUs on each lot in single-family zoned areas. Second, it reduced minimum lot sizes and increased the allowable height of ADUs. Third, it removed the owner occupancy requirement, as well as the parking minimums that were required earlier for ADU development. It is important to note, though, that attached ADUs were allowed in single-family zoned areas in Seattle in 1994, and that detached ADUs were allowed throughout the city in 2010, after a well functioning pilot program. This reform might be seen, then, as a means of fine tuning the jurisdiction's prior ordinances."
"The City Council of Tacoma passed a significant ADU ordinance. This ordinance made three central changes. First, it legalized detached ADUs on single-family zoned areas, whereas prior only attached ADUs were allowed. Second, it removed the prior established owner occupancy requirement. Third, it removed a previously required specific ADU permit from the approval process."
"The City Council of Tacoma is in an ongoing intensive zoning code effort, which may end with some kind of Plex to the city's zoning code. The Home in Tacoma Project, currently in its second phase, is unique both in its focus on anti-displacement strategies, as well as zoning reform, which seeks to allow more varied housing types in the city while also preventing the displacement of low-income residents of color who have been hardest hit by housing affordability issues. This reform will, conditional on its adoption, make at least two important changes. The first is that it will replace its use-based code with a hybrid form based code which should use the inputs of density, scale and housing type as a regulatory model. This change will be done through replacing single- and multi-family zones with three low-scale and mid-scale residential zones, which will allow for Plex  (3-8 units/lot) development within a given range per each district, moderated by affordability bonuses. The second is that it will implement the city's Affordable Housing Action Strategy (AHAS) which has the goals of both promoting affordable housing development, and also instituting anti-displacement policies."
"The City Council of Bellingham passed an ADU ordinance which extended the city's prior code. This ordinance made and affirmed three major specifications. First, attached and detached ADUs were permitted on all single-family zoned districts in the city. Second, it specified that ADUs require one additional parking space, unless a waiver is approved through other means. Third, it specified that the application for an ADU must follow a public hearing process, wherein all those residencies within 500ft of a projected construction have an opportunity to attest it. While this ordinance removed some regulatory barriers, the public hearing process may be seen as a crucial limitation of the ordinance."
"The City of Burien passed an ADU amendment ordinance which made three principal changes to their zoning code. First, it removed the owner occupancy requirement which was earlier a precondition for an ADU approval. Second, it removed the one spot parking minimum for ADUs if the unit is within a 1/4 mile from a transit stop. Third, it allowed 2-ADUs to be permitted on the same lot: one attached and one detached unit."
"The City of Kirkland passed an ADU ordinance which made three central changes to its zoning code. First, it allowed 2-ADUs on a single-family zoned lot, of either attached and detached, or two of either kind. Second, it limited the parking requirement, in cases where there are 2-ADUs on a single lot, to 1 spot. Third, it removed the owner occupancy requirement for the ADU approval process."
"The City of Kenmore passed an ADU ordinance which made four central changes to its zoning code. First, it allowed one ADU on all single-family zoned lots. Second, it specified that no additional parking spot need be added as a requisite for ADU approval. Third, it specified that owner occupancy is only required for the first 6-months following the completion of an ADU. And fourth, it allowed ADU size to vary from 600sqft to 1,500sqft, depending on the lot size wherein it would be established."
"The City of Tukwila adopted an ADU ordinance which made three principal changes to its zoning code. First, it specified that both attached and detached ADUs are allowed on single-family zoned lots, with the condition that no more than one ADU is established per lot. Second, it required owner occupancy of either the ADU or the principal dwelling. Third, it required that there is one parking spot added for an ADU. Due to the owner occupancy requirement, as well as the parking requirement which isn't waived or tied to public transit, some may say that this ADU ordinance may be limited in its capacity to facilitate greater ADU development."
"The City of Tukwila is in the process of codifying updates to its zoning code, to align with recommendations published in its Transit-Oriented Development Housing Strategies Plan. There are three principal changes which the city is intending to make. First, it wants to create an affordable housing incentive program for developing multi-family units, otherwise known as an inclusionary zoning program. Second, it wants to reduce parking minimums by half, in order to reduce the costs associated with residential development. And third, it wants to make changes in its zoning code to allow for missing middle housing in its single-family zoned areas."
"The Yakima County government passed an ADU ordinance which made three central changes to the zoning code. First, it allowed both attached and detached ADUs on single-family zoned land, with the condition that no more than one ADU is established per lot. Second, it required one additional parking spot with the establishment of an ADU. Third, it required owner occupancy in order for an ADU to be approved. A limitation with this ordinance is that ADUs are subject to a public hearing process, which notifies neighbors close to a development that an application has been submitted. This is likely to reduce the effectiveness of this ordinance, and limit the extent to which ADUs may be realized in the jurisdiction."
"The City of Everett passed an ADU ordinance which made one central change to their zoning code. The principal change was that detached ADUs were permitted on single-family zoned land, whereas before, only attached/interior ADUs were permitted. A limitation with the ordinance is that it does not address the effects of public hearings on ADUs, and it did not seek to further insulate the establishment of ADUs from the public comment process."
"The City of Everett passed an ADU ordinance which made at least three central changes to their zoning code. These changes were primarily regulatory. First, the ordinance updated definitions to be more understandable. Second, the ordinance increased the maximum size of ADUs from 800sqft to 1,000sqft. Third, the ordinance expanded the list of zoning districts wherein ADU construction is allowed."
"The Building Opportunity and Choices for All pilot program is a one-year interim zoning program that modifies residential zoning to accelerate construction of more housing in neighborhoods, with more variety in the types of housing being provided. During the pilot program, Planning Services staff will be working with stakeholders and the broader community to create permanent code changes that make housing choice more of a reality for Spokane's residents. The pilot program would allow more housing options to be approved and built citywide within the next 12-18 months. Whether or not the city will come to codify this pilot program into a formal place within the zoning code is undetermined, and only the future will reveal the outcomes of this pilot."
"The Walla Walla City Council passed a zoning reform ordinance, which made three central changes. First, it consolidated previously restrictive low-density residential districts into a common district called: ""Neighborhood Residential"" (NR). Second, it allowed construction of dense housing on NR districts, including cottage homes, duplexes, fourplexes, and tiny homes. Third, it made various changes to its ADU code: increasing maximum square footage, removing owner occupancy requirements, and making the application process ""ministerial"" as opposed to being subject to obstructions caused by public hearing provisions."
"The Village Board of Gilman adopted an ordinance that removed parking minimums from the zoning code. It is unclear what the name or exact date of the ordinance is, but as an extension of the information provided in the zoning code, we have labeled the date as the first of January 2011. The jurisdiction joins a growing list of others who have removed parking minimums from a green-climate, walkability, and housing perspective. For more information, see Title XV: Land Use, Chapter 157: Zoning, Section 157.035(d) of the Gilman Code of Ordinances."
"The City Council of Madison passed an ADU ordinance which significantly changed their prior precedent concerning this building type. There are three central changes made by this ordinance. First, it made ADUs a permitted use across all residential districts, instead of merely a ""conditional"" use. Second, it increased the maximum size of ADUs from 700sqft to 900sqft. Third, it redrafted the code language to make it more clear and specific."
"The City of Madison adopted a Transit Oriented Development overlay zoning district that made four central changes. The first is that it allowed for more dwelling units as permitted uses in TOD areas. The second is that it increased the permitted height, now requiring a two-story minimum height, and also increased dwelling unit counts. The third is that it eliminated vehicle parking minimums, and also reduces vehicle parking maximums. The fourth is that it implemented a more stringent building form and site layout regulation for auto-oriented uses. This overlay extends throughout a large swath of the city (about 15% of all land), and is a considerable move by the city to institute a TOD throughout their jurisdiction."
"The City Council of Laramie passed an ADU ordinance which made three central changes. First, it allowed both attached and detached ADU construction in single-family zoned areas. Second, it specified that only one ADU may be established on a given lot. Third, it specified that the maximum square footage of the ADU should be less than 1,200sqft."
